This is the start of a sipmle command line tool for chrome. To run the code, first clone the repo. Then, from the command line run
```
npm install
```
Then, to build the project, run
```
gulp
```
This will create a build directory in the project. 

To load the extension onto chrome, navigate to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).
Make sure developer mode is on, then click the "load unpacked extension.." button. 
Choose the build directory, and open a new tab.
